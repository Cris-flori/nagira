## Reporting problems

Please use [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/dmytro/nagira/issues?state=open) if you think you found a bug or problem in Nagira. Also please make sure that such issue was not registered yet, or was not yet fixed in newer versions of Nagira (look at the [closed issues](https://github.com/dmytro/nagira/issues?page=1&state=closed) as well as open ones).

However, if you think issue is related to the security and disclosing the issue can harm current users, please refrain from submitting open bug report, instead please feel free to write private email to me (dmytro.kovalov@gmail.com) with the description of the problem (and possible ways to fix it, if you aware of any).
